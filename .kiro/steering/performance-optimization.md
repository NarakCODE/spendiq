# Performance Optimization Guidelines

## Database Performance
- Use proper indexing for frequently queried columns
- Implement connection pooling for PostgreSQL
- Use pagination for large datasets (expenses, budgets)
- Optimize queries with proper joins and filtering
- Use database transactions for consistency

## Frontend Performance
- Implement code splitting with Next.js dynamic imports
- Use lazy loading for heavy components (charts, modals)
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Implement proper caching strategies with TanStack Query
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## API Performance
- Implement request/response caching where appropriate
- Use efficient data serialization
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Optimize file upload handling
- Use background jobs for heavy operations

## Monitoring and Metrics
- Track API response times and error rates
- Monitor database query performance
- Track user interaction metrics
- Implement error logging and alerting
- Monitor file storage usage and cleanup

## Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed data with TanStack Query
- Implement browser caching for static assets
- Use database query result caching
- Cache computed analytics and insights
- Implement proper cache invalidation with query invalidation

## File Storage Optimization
- Organize files in structured directories
- Implement file size limits and validation
- Clean up orphaned files regularly
- Consider CDN for future scaling
- Optimize image compression for receipts
