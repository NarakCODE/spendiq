# Testing Guidelines and Standards

## Testing Strategy
- Write tests for all business logic and API endpoints
- Test user interactions and component rendering
- Include integration tests for database operations
- Add E2E tests for critical user workflows

## Unit Testing
- Test all utility functions and calculations
- Mock external dependencies and API calls
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Aim for high code coverage on business logic

## Component Testing
- Test component rendering with different props
- Test user interactions (clicks, form submissions)
- Test conditional rendering and state changes
- Mock API calls and test loading/error states

## API Testing
- Test all CRUD operations for each model
- Test authentication and authorization
- Test input validation and error responses
- Test pagination and filtering functionality

## Integration Testing
- Test database operations with test database
- Test file upload and storage functionality
- Test email sending and notification systems
- Test recurring expense job execution

## E2E Testing
- Test complete user registration and login flow
- Test expense creation, editing, and deletion
- Test budget creation and progress tracking
- Test team collaboration and permission enforcement
- Test data export functionality

## Test Data Management
- Use factories or fixtures for consistent test data
- Clean up test data after each test
- Use separate test database for isolation
- Mock external services and APIs
