# Testing Guidelines and Standards

## Testing Philosophy

- Focus on testing strategy and patterns rather than implementation
- Prioritize critical business logic and user workflows
- Document testing approaches without writing actual test scripts
- Emphasize test design and coverage planning over test execution

## Testing Strategy Overview

- Identify key areas that require testing coverage
- Plan test scenarios for business logic and API endpoints
- Consider user interaction patterns and component behavior
- Design integration test approaches for database operations
- Outline E2E test scenarios for critical user workflows

## Unit Testing Approach

- Target utility functions and calculations for testing
- Plan mocking strategies for external dependencies and API calls
- Identify error handling and edge cases to cover
- Focus on business logic coverage planning

## Component Testing Strategy

- Plan component rendering tests with different props
- Design user interaction test scenarios (clicks, form submissions)
- Consider conditional rendering and state change testing
- Plan API call mocking and loading/error state testing

## API Testing Planning

- Outline CRUD operation testing for each model
- Plan authentication and authorization test scenarios
- Design input validation and error response testing
- Consider pagination and filtering functionality testing

## Integration Testing Design

- Plan database operation testing with test database
- Design file upload and storage functionality testing
- Consider email sending and notification system testing
- Plan recurring expense job execution testing

## E2E Testing Scenarios

- Design complete user registration and login flow testing
- Plan expense creation, editing, and deletion testing
- Outline budget creation and progress tracking testing
- Design team collaboration and permission enforcement testing
- Plan data export functionality testing

## Test Data Strategy

- Plan use of factories or fixtures for consistent test data
- Design test data cleanup strategies
- Plan separate test database usage for isolation
- Consider mocking strategies for external services and APIs

## Implementation Note

- These guidelines focus on testing strategy and planning
- Actual test script implementation should be done when specifically requested
- Prioritize understanding test requirements over writing test code
